# ASSMU-Website-Final

This is our senior project trying giving students a hub to find information on student life at Saint Martin's University. It will show time and dates of events,
clubs that are available, resources / information for starting your own clubs, and who the student government are. 

This is our Tech Stack: 

- React - Front-End 
- Node.Js - Back-End
- Cosmic.js - Database 


## How to Run Website
The reason we created two different projects is so that it was easier for us to identify which api calls we were making and which portion of the code was "front-end"
or "back-end" this also allows for the ability to customize the api and attach a mySQL database later on since it is not intact with our front-end code.
